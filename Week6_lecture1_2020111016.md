## The Edit Distance Problem
The edit distance between two strings can be alternatively termed as the *cost of alignment*.\ 
For instance, the words `SUNNY` and `SNOWY` can be aligned in the following way to have the minimum edit distance.
```
S - N O W Y
S U N N - Y
```
Here, the edit distance is 3 (as the number of differing columns is 3).\
Hence, given two strings $x[1 \dotsm m]$ and $y[1 \dotsm n]$, the minimum edit distance between them is to be found, as efficiently a possible.

## The Dynamic Programming Solution
Given the above two strings, a natural subproblem to approach would be one, where the **edit distance of some prefix** of the two strings is to be found.\
Let us term the edit distance between $x[1 \dotsm i]$ and $y[1 \dotsm j]$, where $i\leq m$ and $j\leq n$ as $E(i,j)$.\
The final goal is finding $E(m,n)$.

### Subprobleming the subproblem
Now, in order to express $E(i,j)$ into further smaller subproblems, we look at the rightmost columns of the two substrings. The possibilities are:\
`x[i]` and ` -  ` => Cost = 1 => $E(i,j) = 1 + E(i-1,j)$\
` -  ` and `y[j]` => Cost = 1 => $E(i,j) = 1 + E(i,j-1)$\
`x[i]` and `y[j]` => Cost = 1 if `x[i]!=y[j]`, else 0 => $E(i,j) = diff(x[i],y[j]) + E(i-1,j-1)$\

### Ordering
In accordance with the principle of dynamic programming, the smaller subproblem should be solved before the larger one. i.e. $E(i-1,j), E(i,j-1), E(i-1,j-1)$ should all be solved before solving $E(i,j)$\

### Algorithm
Since we have termed our subproblems with respect to the **rightmost columns** of the substrings, the base cases we need to separately take care of are $E(i,0)$ and $E(0,j)$.\
But these cases are trivial, as the edit distance between a nonzero length string and an ampty string, is the nonzero length itself.\
Hence, we have $E(i,0) = i$ and $E(0,j) = j$

In accordance with the notation $E(i,j)$, we implement this solution using a memoization table, which we shall conveniently call `E`.\
Algorithm:
```py
# E[m+1][n+1]
# diff is a function that returns 0 if the characters at the string indices corresponding to the two arguments are equal, 1 if they are not
def EditDistance():
	for i in range(m+1):
		E[i][0]=i
	for j in range(n+1):
		E[0][j]=j
	for i in range(m+1):
		for j in range(n+1):
			E[i][j]=min(1+E[i-1][j],1+E[i][j-1],diff(i,j)+E[i-1][j-1])
	return E[m][n]
```
The complexity of the above algorithm is naturally $O(mn)$\
The underlying DAG for this problem is such that:
- Its nodes correspond to the table values of $E$.
- The edges (dependencies) between nodes reflect the 'ordering' constraints above, i.e. $E(i-1,j), E(i,j-1), E(i-1,j-1)$ should all be solved before solving $E(i,j)$
