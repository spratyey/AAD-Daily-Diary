## Membership Queries
As established in lecture 1, 
Computational problems can be posed as membership queries in languages.\
For eg.
1. Asking *'is the given graph bipartite'* is exactly the same as *'does the given graph belong to the set of all bipartite graphs?'*
2. The problem *'is 2 a prime number'* can framed as membership query '*is 2 a member of the set of prime numbers?'* As this is modelled as a decision problem, the output is either a 0 or a 1.

A language is the collection of all finite length binary bit-strings.
i.e. A subset of infinitely long 0-1 bit-strings $\{ 0,1 \}^{*}$

The natural question now is,\
**Are there computational problems for which no computational solutions exist?**

## Countability and Computation
Put simply, there are an uncountable number of computational problems, but there can only exist contably many computational solutions.\
Hence, there must be uncountably many problems for which no solution exists.

### Countable sets
All finite sets are inherently countable.\
An infinite set $\text{S}$ is countable if there exists a bijection from $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \text{S}$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers.

Intuitively, the modern equivalent for countability is 'array-bility'.
That is, does it make sense to have an **i<sup>th</sup> element** of the array.
A set is countable if it is **enumerable** or **indexable**.\
This idea forms the backbone of the argument as to why there exist an uncountable number of unsolvable computational problems.

### Proving that the number of possible programs is countable
Firstly, we state *without loss of generality* that we only need to prove that the set of all *C Programs* is countable. This is due to the fact that every program that can be written in some other language can be written equivalently in C.\
Now,\
A C program is nothing but a finite length bit-string. 
It cannot be an infinite bit-string as that would violate an axiom of computation.

### Proving that the set of finite length bit-strings $\{ 0, 1\} ^{*}$ is countable
**Candidate Bijection**\
$1 \rightarrow \epsilon$ (null string)\
$2 \rightarrow 0$\
$3 \rightarrow 1$\
$4 \rightarrow 00$\
$5 \rightarrow 01$\
$6 \rightarrow 10$\
$7 \rightarrow 11$\
$8 \rightarrow 000$\
and so on...\
Thus, a 1 to 1 correspondence $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{*}$ has been established by listing all possible finite bit strings in short-lex order.\
$f$ is **one-one** as every bit-string occurs *exactly* once, an inherent consequence of using the short-lex order.\
$f$ is **onto** as every member belonging to the set of finite bit-strings has a pre-image in $\mathbb{N}$\
Hence, proved.

### Proving that the set of possible computational problems is uncountable
As a problem is modelled as a language, hence the cardinality of the set of all possible problems is the cardinality of $\textbf{P}(\{ 0,1 \} ^*)$
Thus, it suffices to prove the following:

### Proving that the power set of bit strings is uncountable
Any subset of $\textbf{P}(\{ 0,1 \} ^*)$ can be represented by the output of the function $f: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1 \}$. The function outputs 1 for elements in the subset, and vice versa. Hence, each subset of $\textbf{P}(\{ 0,1 \} ^*)$ corresponds to exactly one unique 'indicator' bit-string.\
For eg. the subset ${0,00,000,001}$ has the indicator $010100011$

Now,\
Cantor's diabolical diagonalization argument provides a way to generate a new indicator string that is not present for any subset of $\textbf{P}(\{ 0,1 \} ^*)$ at all.\
This is done by constructing a *brand new indicator*, by flipping one of the bits from one of the currently existing indicators, ensuring that the new indicator is completely unaccounted for in the current set. Hence, as a bijection exists from $\mathbb{N}$ to all the *currently-accounted-for* bit-strings, the existence of an unaccounted-for bit-string implies that the power set of bit strings is uncountable.


|     | $\epsilon$ | $0$ | $1$  | $00$ | ... |
| --- | ---------- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| $L_1$    | `1`           |  1   |   1   |   0   |      |     
| $L_2$    |    0        |  `0`   |   0   |    0  |      |     
| $L_3$    |      1      |   0  |   `0`   |    0  |      |     
| ...    |           |     |  |  |  |     
|  $newL$    |   `0`   |`1`     |`1`     | ...    |      


Hence, proved.

**Hence, there are many more computational problems than comuter programs, and there are problems that computers cannot solve.**

An example: it is impossible to write fully reliable code to input two programs and check whether both of them solve the same problem.

## The Turing Machine
The turing machine is a 7-tuple ($Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject}$), where:
* $Q$ is the finite set of states
* $\Sigma$ is the finite input alphabet state
* $\Gamma$ is the finite tape alphabet, containing atleast one more member than $\Sigma$, i.e. the EoF character
* $\delta$ is the instruction/program of the Turing machine, represented as a transition function $\delta:(Q\times\Gamma) \rightarrow (Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\})$ (where L,R specify whether to move to the left or right)
* $q_0$ is the start state
* $q_{accept}$ is the accept state
* $q_{reject}$ is the reject state

The input tape is fed into the turing machine, and depending on the contents of the tape, the machine either accept or rejects the input based on whether the membership query is valid or not, or simply runs forever.

*C Programs are turing complete* i.e. if no C program exists for a particular problem, that implies no algorithm/machine exists for that problem.
