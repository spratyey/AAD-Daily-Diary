## An Introduction to Computational Problems
This course, in essence, deals with **computational problems**.
The very question of what a computational problem even is, is not very starightforward to answer. 
Therefore, we first need to be able to define what distinguishes a computational problem from the general meaning the word 'problem' carries. The formal way to do that is using a **mathematical model** to rigourously define  computational problems. Similarly, a computational solution to a problem can also be defined, and all the different techniques that are utilised in that pursuit can be explored thereafter.

## What exactly is a computational problem?
Posing a computational problem itself can be challenging.
1. There is always the issue about objectively defining a problem such that solving it as stated results in the right solution. i.e. *'Posing a problem without solving it'*.
2. Sometimes, the very nature of the computational problem results in there being multiple/infinite ways to pose it. Eg. 'Count the total number of computational problems.' Quite perplexing.
3. The constraints of the problem, and the tools that are available to the solver need to be carefully considered.
4. **Is the problem that is being posed a compuational problem in the first place?**

Hence, it is imperative to mathematically define what a computation problem is.
*Without loss of generality* we assume:
* The input can be digitized i.e. represented using discrete symbols (0 and 1).
* The problem is a decision problem (i.e. the output is a single bit, 0 or 1).
Hence,
* Computational problems can be posed as membership queries in languages.
**i.e.** Suppose the input is a bit String `X`, Output a `1` if it belongs to the language `L`, else output `0`.
**i.e.** Does `X` belong to the subset of possible inputs that produce output `1` (which is the 'language under consideration')?
**For eg.** Asking `'is the given graph bipartite'` is exactly the same as `'does the given graph belong to the set of all bipartite graphs?'`

To summarise, 
What is a computational problem?
**A membership query in a set**

## Computation in the Real World 
Due to the above definition of a computational problem, mathematicians and scientists were able to prove several things, including but not limited to results such as 'Why there exist certain problems for which a finite resource solution cannot exist'.
To determine what makes an algorthm an algorithm to begin with, which forms the basis for subsequent commentary, and to understand why resource limitations exist, we need to understand the **'Axioms of Computation'**
1. It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from a location. 
`Machines are not omnipresent`
2. Only finite information can be stored/retrieved from finite space. 
`Machines are not omniscient`
3. A finite length code exrts finite amount of control. 
`Machines are not omnipotent`

## What exactly is a computational solution?
Putting the above axioms together, we have the fundamental finite state machine having access to an infintie sequential tape, which is divided into a number of finite sized cells such that there is only one read/write head in one cell at one time, and each cell can be written to using a finite set of symbols. In other words, the **Turing Machine**.
As long as our machine makes the above three assumptions, it can be simulated by a Turing Machine, no matter how advanced it is.
Thus, looking at a solution, we can determine if it is a computational solution or not based on whether it makes exactly these three assumptions.

## Comparing various solutions
1. **Comparing time**
The primary and most intuitive way of comparing two solutions is comparing the amount of time they take. Time is _the_ most precious commodity, as according the aforementioned axioms, it is non-reusable.
2. **Comparing Space**
Although modern physics establishes a relationship between time and spcae, for the purpose of computation, memory/space is a distinct resource, and an important factor to consider while  comparing algorithms.
3. **Worst case analysis**
Worst case analysis is a useful and widely used metric in analysing, as the name suggests, the worst possible performance of the algorithm for any possible input.
4. **Asymptotic analysis**
Comparing the performance of algorithm as the input size grows is a useful metric, within a certain threshold.
